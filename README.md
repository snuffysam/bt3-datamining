# bt3-datamining
Java code for datamining BT3.
This code only works with extracted UNK files that are given names in Japanese, since that's all that was available at the time I wrote this code.
I believe Sparking Studio does a better job with both filenames and filetypes so you may have to modify the code to match that.
